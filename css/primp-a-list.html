	<h1>AI Assisted CSS Styling</h1>
	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<ol class="instructions">
		<li>
			First, look at the CSS selectors in the &lt;style&gt; tag of this page, and make sure you understand each of
			them.
		</li>
		<li>
			Use AI to style the book list below.
		</li>
		<li>
			Have the AI generate at least 3 different versions of the styled book list:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Make sure to include the HTML code for the book list in your prompt, so that the AI can understand
					how the content is structured.
				</li>
				<li>
					To get different versions of the list, alter the prompt you enter (for example you might tell the AI
					to make one version "fancy", another version "minimalist", and another version "colorful").
				</li>
				<li>You may want to tell the AI to keep the CSS somewhat simple so you can understand it.</li>
				<li>Make sure to review the CSS code that AI generates, to help you learn CSS.</li>
				<li>You should ask the AI questions about the CSS it generates (you could tell it that you're a student
					in a Web Programming class).</li>
				<li>Make sure to create at least one version that uses 'cards'</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			After experimenting with AI:
			<ol>
				<li>
					Choose one version of the AI generated lists and apply the CSS to the book list on this page, but
					make sure that your CSS only affects the book list and not other elements on the page.
				</li>
				<li>Answer the question under the list.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Books</h2>
	<ul class="book-list">

	<h2>Question</h2>
	<p>What are 3 things you learned about CSS from doing this activity? Replace the content in the LI elements below
		with your answer.</p>
	<div class="answer">
		<ol>
			<li>The first thing I noticed that I hope to remember and apply to my projects is that all of the stylings
				are referencing elements nested in the element with the "book-list" class</li>
			<li>I learned (more reinforced what I already learened the other morning in DevOps) is specificity when
				prompting AI. The more specific I am in my prrompt,the better the results will be.</li>
			<li>The last thing I learned was how the different parts of the box-shadow affect the final appearance and what adjusting each off them does to get the desired result. </li>
		</ol>
