# Control Structures
In Web 1 you learned about the following **control structures**:
1. IF Statements (and all of their variations)
1. While Loops
1. For Loops

Now you will explore the control structures that are listed below. 
For each one, write a brief paragraph that describes the control
structure and the situations when you would use it.
Also, include a fun and imaginative code sample that demonstrates 
the control structure.
